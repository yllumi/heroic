## Welcome to Heroic

**Heroic** is a modern PHP package designed to bring progressive web development features into the CodeIgniter 4 ecosystem. It enables developers to build fast, flexible, and dynamic web applications using a folder-based routing system and seamless page transitions—resembling the behavior of Single Page Applications (SPA)—all while keeping the codebase clean and familiar. With built-in support for native JavaScript through AlpineJS and smooth routing powered by Pinecone Router, Heroic empowers developers to stay productive without the need for compile steps or complex build tools. Just write PHP, enhance with native JS, and build progressively—Heroic makes it effortless.
